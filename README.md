## ACP controle times


## AJAX and Flask reimplementation

The current RUSA controle time calculator is a Perl script that takes an HTML form and emits a text page. The reimplementation will fill in times as the input fields are filled.  Each time a distance is filled in, the corresponding open and close times should be filled in.   If no begin time has been provided, use 0:00 as the begin time. 

I will leave much of the design to you.  

## Testing

A requirement of this project will be designing a systematic test suite.
